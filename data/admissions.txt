Economic Value of Obtaining a Master’s Degree
In today’s economy, employers are demanding a master’s degree for many of their growing professional and leadership roles. According to
Forbes
, economists and other scholars have documented substantial salary premiums, economic opportunities and benefits for master’s degree study – and these human capital benefits are only increasing.
The report indicates that virtually all of the growth in the salary premium, attributable to college education over the last decade was due to advanced degrees, with holders of advanced degrees currently earning a 30% wage premium on average over those with only a bachelor’s degree. The report also states that the unemployment rate for individuals holding a master’s degree was only 3.4% in 2013, compared to 6.1% for all workers based on the
U.S. Department of Labor
data.
